			<p> Before you can submit your first results, you need to register with CodaLab and login to participate. Only then you can submit results to the evaluation server, which will score your submission on the non-public test set.
				<header>
					<h3>Steps </h3>
				</header>
				<li>Prepare your submission in the required format, as described under the Evaluation section. 
					We expects you to share a single zip.</li>
				<li>Use the validation script from code repo  to ensure that the folder structure and number of label files in the zip file is correct. 
						All submissions count towards the overall maximum number of submissions!</li>
				<li> Go to Participate and the Submit / View Results page.</li>
				<li>Select the appropriate phase, i.e., Single Scan or Multiple Scan, for which you computed the results.</li>
				<li>Enter the required fields, where you can supply also later more details, if you need to take care of 
						anonymity in case of double blind submissions.</li>
				<li>Then you have to click "Submit" in the lower part of the page, which will open a file dialog. 
					In the file dialog, you have to select your submission zip file, which will be then uploaded.</li>				    
					<!--  - The evaluation takes roughly 10 minutes to complete and you will have the choice, which of your submission gets added to the leaderboard. -->
				Good luck with your submission!

				<h2>How to Participate </h2>
			</header>
			<p> Submission Policy: Only the training set is provided for learning the parameters of the algorithms. The test set should be used only for reporting the final results compared to other approaches - it must not be used in any way to train or tune systems, for example, by evaluating multiple parameters or feature choices and reporting the best results obtained. Thus, we impose an upper limit (currently 5 attempts) on the number of submissions. It is the participant's responsibility to divide the training set into proper training and validation splits, e.g., we use sequence 08 for validation. The tuned algorithms should then be run - ideally - only once on the test data and the results of the test set should not be used to adapt the approach.
			 </p>
			<p>We ask each participant to upload the final results of their algorithm/paper submission only once to the server and perform all other experiments on the validation set. If participants would like to report results in their papers for multiple versions of their algorithm (e.g., parameters or features), this must be done on the validation data and only the best performing setting of the novel method may be submitted for evaluation to our server. If comparisons to baselines from third parties (which have not been evaluated on the benchmark website) are desired, please contact us for a discussion.
